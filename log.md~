# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: For the first day of the challange I decided to keep it simple. For the past few weaks I have been doing freeCodeCamp. Today I started Javascript section and I can say that it is really interesting and exciting. Also I decided to do JavaScript30 course https://javascript30.com/ throughout this journey. Learned some basics in JS and how to properly fork project from git, clone it, change it and pull it back to my repository.

**Thoughts**: Excited to be as much prolific as possible. I would rate my programming knowledge somewhere below medium, so by doing this challange hopefully I will get better, more advanced and increase my capability on working with some of the popular programming frameworks.
