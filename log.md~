# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: For the first day of the challange I decided to keep it simple. For the past few weaks I have been doing freeCodeCamp. Today I started Javascript section and I can say that it is really interesting and exciting. Also I decided to do JavaScript30 course https://javascript30.com/ throughout this journey. Learned some basics in JS and how to properly fork project from git, clone it, change it and pull it back to my repository.

**Thoughts**: Excited to be as much prolific as possible. I would rate my programming knowledge somewhere below medium, so by doing this challange hopefully I will get better, more advanced and increase my capability on working with some of the popular programming frameworks.

### Day 2: June 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: For a couple of hours I have been learning Javascript on freeCodeCamp. Learned useful pop, push, shift and unshift functions also as how to properly use switch. Started my first tutorial video on Javascript30 and created an Drum Kit using JQuery. Also learned how to make commits to git from cloned repository to my repository.

**Thoughts**: Javascript in freeCodeCamp was quite relaxing. After couple of hours I moved on to building Drum kit and it really was stressfull basically to set up environment to code. After an hour I made a Drum Kit and decided to commit it to my git. After a few hours of figuring out I managed to push it... It's almost 3 AM right now, but I am proud of what I did today.
