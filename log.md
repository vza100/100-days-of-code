# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: April 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: For the first day of the challange I decided to keep it simple. For the past few weaks I have been doing freeCodeCamp. Today I started Javascript section and I can say that it is really interesting and exciting. Also I decided to do JavaScript30 course https://javascript30.com/ throughout this journey. Learned some basics in JS and how to properly fork project from git, clone it, change it and pull it back to my repository.

**Thoughts**: Excited to be as much prolific as possible. I would rate my programming knowledge somewhere below medium, so by doing this challange hopefully I will get better, more advanced and increase my capability on working with some of the popular programming frameworks.


### Day 2: April 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: For a couple of hours I have been learning Javascript on freeCodeCamp. Learned useful pop, push, shift and unshift functions also as how to properly use switch. Started my first tutorial video on Javascript30 and created an Drum Kit using JQuery. Also learned how to make commits to git from cloned repository to my repository.

**Thoughts**: Javascript in freeCodeCamp was quite relaxing. After couple of hours I moved on to building Drum kit and it really was stressfull basically to set up environment to code. After an hour I made a Drum Kit and decided to commit it to my git. After a few hours of figuring out I managed to push it... It's almost 3 AM right now, but I am proud of what I did today.

### Day 3: April 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished Javascript section on freeCodeCAmp course. Basics feel quite easy, mostly beacuse it is similar to C++ which I have been learning in IT class at school. Also learned how to apply CSS to Class with JS depending on what time it is while watching JS30 course.

**Thoughts**: Quite happy with the proggres as I spend most of my day learning new stuff. Feeling much more confident while working with objects in JS.

### Day 4: April 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing freeCodeCamp front End development program. Finally finished Javascript section and Object Oriented & Functional Programming which I really enjoyed doing. Half way through Algorithm Scripting which requires some time to handle but it is managable. A little bit of practice with CSS variables by watching Javascript30 third tutorial. Also started a "JavaScript - Understanding the Weird Parts" which at the first glance seems quite useful.

**Thoughts**: Full production mode on. Spending almost my whole free time programming and I could say that I am enjoying it. Javascript seems quite a strong tool when you start handling it correctly. Staying positive and produvtive as much as possible.

### Day 5: April 30, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started the day by finishing freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting. Moved on to JSON APis and AJAX. For the rest of the day I have been building Random quote generator. It was really challanging but with the help of the various forums I made a suitible for usage web application.

**Thoughts**: Really exhausted after full day of coding, but seeing the result keeps me motivated to strive further.

### Day 6: May 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished Random Quote generator, made it suitable for smaller screens, adjusted responsive design to columns and font. Also watched Javascript30 #5 tutorial which helped me to practice basic JS scripting which is the key to functional programming.

**Thoughts**: A little bit frustrated that I somehow manage to corrupt my Ubuntu operation system and it took me 3 hours to put everything together. Still happy with the progress I made and motivated to get even better at coding.
